    <h1>Oatmeal raisin Cookies</h1>
    <p>Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are an old-time favorite of all. This is a delicious yet healthy recipe which is relatively low in calories. The recipe is also perfect for vegetarians due to being egg-free. A great thing about this recipe is its versatility. The recipe can be adjusted to create a softer, chewier cookie or crunchier, harder cookie. The trick to making a softer cookie is reducing the amount of flour, and adding more butter or margarine. Likewise, the secret to making a crunchier cookie is to do the complete opposite. In other words, add more flour and less butter or margarine.</p>
    <p>No matter what the occasion, oatmeal raisin cookies, will be an <em>enormous</em> success. Not only are they loved by children, but adults, as well. Enjoy these with a hot cup of tea, coffee, or a cold glass of milk.</p>
