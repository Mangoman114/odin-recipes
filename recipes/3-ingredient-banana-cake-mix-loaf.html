    <h1>3 ingredient banana cake mix loaf</h1>
    <p>3 ingredient banana cake mix loaf is out of this world. Itâ€™s hard to believe that anything so good can come from 3 simple ingredients. Ironically enough, I tired it out at a social function the other day and responses were incredible. People actually thought that I had spend hours slaving over a hot stove and oven. Of course when I told them the truth, their jaws dropped.</p>
    <p>It is made with ripe bananas, eggs, and the cake mix of your choice. It doesn't get much simpler. Most will think it's a recipe that your grandmother passed down.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large ripe bananas</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>432 grams cake mix</li>
        <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the bananas to a mixing bowl. Using a fork or potato masher, mash them up until they are smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add in the eggs and fold with a spatula. Then, add in the cake mix and fold once again. Lastly, place the chocolate chips in and fold once more.</li>
        <li>Coat a loaf pan with baking spray or melted butter. Line the bottom with parchment paper. Pour the cake mix in until it's about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Place in a 350 degree F or 180 C preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes until an inserted tooth pick comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Place the loaf on a wire rack and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Remove the loaf from the pan, slice, and serve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your banana cake mix loaf!</li>
